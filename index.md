## Summary
Data Scientist & GIS Software Specialist

With over a decade of experience in multinational environments, including governmental and commercial sectors, I specialize in information systems, combining an interest in research with technical and programming skills in data engineering and analysis. I also worked with various data (high-dimensional satellite and aerial-drone data, etc.) and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software.

Notably in Switzerland, I have contributed to research-driven AI projects such as AI Model Zoo, Meta Spoof with the Meta Quest Pro AR/VR headset (VRBiom), in-Car Biometrics, Aim-Gate, CarMen, and PopEye, utilizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and technologies.
